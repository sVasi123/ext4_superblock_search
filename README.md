This tool was developed to recover data from a crashed QNAP NAS. It reads an input file in large chunks, searching for primary ext4 superblocks using the ext4 magic number and QNAP signature. When a superblock is detected, the tool displays its key information. This utility is useful for scanning large disk images (IMG files) dumped from an LVM physical volume to locate the offsets of ext4 partitions within LVM logical volumes.
